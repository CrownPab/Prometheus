# Prometheus

https://github.com/VitalGolub/Prometheus/  
  
Instructions:  
The project uses gradle, you can either create a runnable to jar to run the game or I created a runApp task that you can use. If you are using eclipse you can simply open the task view, open the build tasks and double click runApp. You can also manually run the main classes as well.  
  
Through gradle, "gradle runApp"
